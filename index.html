	<p>Hello everyone, Here to see the visualization that we made of the members appointed to boards of BC Crown Corporations?</p>
	<p>Well, I'm sorry to say, but we're going to disappoint you.</p>
	<p>It has come to our attention that the information that our visualization was based on, from the 
		<a href="http://www.fin.gov.bc.ca/BRDO/">Board Resourcing and Development Office</a>,
		is under a quite wide arching Copyright policy from the Government of British Columbia, 
		available <a href="http://www.gov.bc.ca/com/copy/">here</a>.</p>
	<p>As such, we no longer feel that we can provide this tool.</p>
	<p>Sorry to disappoint.</p>
